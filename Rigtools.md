WARNING: Links may sometimes be down. If so, try a different one.

Instructions:

Open ```devtools://devtools/bundled/devtools_app.html```

Open one of the links above in a new tab (if they are blocked, cry in a corner)

Click on the "Network" tab, wait a couple seconds and double click the gray box

Click the extension id button and paste in your blocking extension's id (it has to be installed by administrator and it has to have the ability to manage other extensions) (For Lightspeed the ID is adkcpkpghahmbopkjchobieckeoaoeem)

Click Remove Bloat, then confirm, then press Disable Injected Extension

Note: After using rigtools, the chrome.management page will always be located at filesystem:chrome-extension://ext-id/temporary/index.html. It is recommended to bookmark this page as it persists after shutdown and is only overwritten by using rigtools again
